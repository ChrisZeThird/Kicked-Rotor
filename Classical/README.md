# About the classical kicked rotor

A classical system is said to be chaotic when its dynamics are highly sensitive to initial conditions. The Kicked Rotor is one of the simplest systems exhibiting such a property.

The goal here is to study the evolution of the energy of the system and its diffusion properties in a first approximation to then create a code capables of displaying the quantum properties of the kicked rotor.
