# Kicked-Rotor

This is a collection of programs developped during a 2 weeks internship at the University of Lille. 
The internship takes place in the Cold Atoms team of the PHLAM laboratory, "Quantum Chaos" group. This group has seven permanent members and four PhD students.
The activities of the quantum chaos group are based on an internationally recognised expertise in the theoretical and experimental study of Anderson localization, a problem posed in the context of disordered media in condensed matter and addressed here in an original system based on cold atoms and the "stricken rotator" model. This group, which has several very fruitful collaborations with theorists and mathematicians through the CEMPI Laboratory of Excellence (European Centre for Mathematics, Physics and their Interactions) and with the Interactions) and with the Kastler Brossel laboratory (ENS, Sorbonne and Coll√®ge de France), which has three Nobel Prize winners.

This internship focused on the modelisation of the Kicked Rotor, both in classical and quantum cases, with the goal to study the specific case of a spin-1/2 particle.
