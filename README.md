# Kicked-Rotor

This is a collection of programs developed during a 2 weeks internship at the University of Lille. 
The internship takes place in the Cold Atoms team of the PHLAM laboratory, "Quantum Chaos" group. This group has seven 
permanent members and four PhD students. The activities of the quantum chaos group are based on an internationally 
recognised expertise in the theoretical and experimental study of Anderson localization, a problem posed in the context 
of disordered media in condensed matter and addressed here in an original system based on cold atoms and the "stricken 
rotator" model. This group, which has several very fruitful collaborations with theorists and mathematicians through the 
CEMPI Laboratory of Excellence (European Centre for Mathematics, Physics and their Interactions) and with the Kastler 
Brossel laboratory (ENS, Sorbonne and Coll√®ge de France), which has three Nobel Prize winners.

This internship focused on the modelisation of the Kicked Rotor, both in classical and quantum cases, with the goal to study the specific case of a spin-1/2 particle.

***Disclaimer (06/2023):*** _This project was created before I knew how to use git, and before I had access to Pycharm. The structure
of the code might not be very intelligible. Moreover, the code might not be legible all the time with non-explicit variable
names. A short restructuring will be done over the time to make this project more accessible._
