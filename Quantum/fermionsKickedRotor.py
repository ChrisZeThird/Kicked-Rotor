""" As the kicked rotor was studied for only one particle distribution, I also worked on the case of multiple
    fermions distributions. Naturally, the functions from other file in this folder must be used if you want to
    see what happens in that very specific case. The use of fermions simply allows us to set one particle for each
    energy/impulsion."""
