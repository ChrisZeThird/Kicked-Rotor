# Quantum approach

The classical case was a first approximation of the model. But in the quantum world, the behaviors of the particles completely change as the notion of *chaos* disappears. Quantum Chaos refers to a Quantum system with an analog chaotic classical system.

# The Random Kicked Rotor

Instead of using pseudo-impulsions, the 'RKR' requires a randomly generated impulsions array. Those values correspond to random phase related to the different
roads a particle can take between two points. This model is supposed to be more precise than the QKR (Quantum Kicked Rotor) as it takes more trajectories into account
and reproduce the randomness of the particle travel better.

This approach is possible thanks to a boolean parameter in the first class of function in the QKR file.
